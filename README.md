# Algorithm Drill Shuffle 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Sometimes, you want to add a bit of chaos to your data.  Too many ordered lists can get... boring.

Writing your own `shuffle` method is a good way to explore looping through collections.

And no, you are **not** allowed to use `Array#shuffle` method or `Array#sort_by`.  The point of this challenge is to get you to delve into the algorithm, not use a pre-built solution.  That would be a cop-out. 

Need Help?  Try looking at the [Knuth Shuffle Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).

## Learning Objectives

- Iterating elements in an enumerable
- Using randomization methods like [rand](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-rand) and/or [Array#sample](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-sample)

## Objectives

### Write a Method to Shuffle an Array

Write a `shuffle` method that takes an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order.  One important property of a good `shuffle` method is that every permutation is equally likely.

Use the driver code in the gist to check and be sure that the method truly does shuffle the elements in the array each time it is called.
